This playbook installs and configures my Ubuntu Desktop on proxmox, configures the VM and containers.

## Playbook capabilities

> **NOTE:** The Playbook is fully configurable. You can skip or reconfigure any task by [Overriding Defaults](#overriding-defaults).

* Most common actions can be performed by issuing the associated `make` command. Go to Makefile to see what it can do.
  * Most of these make commands that run plays where you need verbose output (-vvv), simply append `-v` to the make target and it will run it verbosely, e.g. `make update-compose-v`

## Setup the Ansible Control Node (where you will run the playbook from)

### If it is this same machine

Remember to clone and setup the [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/samis-group/dotfiles).

Setup things:
```bash
mkdir -p .ssh
cd .ssh/
touch id_rsa_personal id_ecdsa_git
# Fill in these ssh keys
chmod 600 id_*
ssh-add id_*
# Install openssh-server so we can connect and run tasks
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server make
sudo ufw allow ssh      # If running ufw
touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# Make sure root user has the key as well
touch /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
# Add your public keys there
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

1. Clone this repo locally (change to https method if you aren't me):

```bash
git clone git@gitlab.com:th3cookie/ubuntu-desktop-playbook.git
cd linux-desktop-playbook/
```

2. Run the following command substituting your ansible vault password as required (skip inputting the password argument if you don't use ansible-vault or you have already stored this password in `~/.ansible/password` as per my other playbooks). This will [install ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html), upgrade pip and store your password inside of the file located in `~/.ansible/password` for use with `ansible-vault`:

```bash
# Use single quotes only!
export VAULT_PASS='super_secret_password'
make setup
```

| :exclamation:  IMPORTANT!  |
|----------------------------|

There is a ***very small*** chance that your password will not have exported into the file correctly as `make` and `bash` don't handle special characters well, as much as I tried to make it. It will be fine if you have a normal password with no successive backslashes like '\\\\' for example. The script will warn you if it failed and will tell you to use [this python script instead](./bin/parse_pass.py):

```bash
./bin/parse_pass.py 'super_secret_password'
```

3. Copy the [inventory.example](./inventory.example) file and fill it in with your host IP address and local admin account credentials:

```bash
cp inventory.example inventory
```

4. Do the same with all of the files in the [group_vars](./group_vars) folder.

:information_source: **If you want to encrypt/decrypt your files, just issue these commands**:

```bash
make decrypt
# or
make encrypt
```

## Provision the Ubuntu Desktop in Proxmox

> ❗ **If you have already provisioned the VM, skip this step. I'm using Proxmox to provision the VM.** ❗

Before running ansible, Ensure you have created a template from an OS that can be cloned.

Populate your proxmox vars in [this defaults file in the `provision-docker-vm` role](roles/provision-docker-vm/defaults/main.yml) according to how you want to provision the Ubuntu Desktop in your proxmox environment.

Install dependencies required on the **proxmox host** (if required - i.e. first time):

```bash
ssh proxmox
apt install python3-pip && pip3 install proxmoxer requests
```

Now let's deploy our Ubuntu Desktop to proxmox:

```bash
make provision-vm
```

### Deploy SSH key and test

**TBA** deploy key

Now let's test to ensure connectivity (specify the inventory file if not running in the same dir as it with the `-i` flag):

```bash
ansible --vault-password-file ~/.ansible/password docker -m ping
```

Ensure that your inventory file is correctly setup (**Hint**: You can run `make decrypt` to decrypt your vaulted files:

```bash
ansible-vault edit --vault-password-file ~/.ansible/password inventory
```

#### Troubleshooting Host Setup

**TBA**

## Running the Playbook

If you have setup your vault password and ran the `make setup` task successfully, just run the following to execute the playbook in it's entirety:

```bash
make
# or
make execute
```

*Alternatively*:

```bash
ansible-playbook --vault-password-file ~/.ansible/password main.yml
```

### Running a specific set of tagged tasks

You can also filter which part of the provisioning process to run by specifying a set of tags like so:

```bash
make run-tags logrotate,install_docker
```

*Alternatively*, the long hand way:

```bash
ansible-playbook --vault-password-file ~/.ansible/password main.yml --tags "logrotate,install_docker"
```

❗ The tags available can be listed by running this command:

```bash
make list-tags
```

## Overriding Defaults

You can override any of the defaults configured in `vars/default_config.yml` by creating a `vars/config.yml` file, and setting the overrides in there. For example, you can tell it to configure the hostname, and pass in the hostname value to configure it to with something like:

```yaml
configure_hostname: true
custom_hostname: myhostname
```

For a full list of variables, run this:

```bash
make list-vars
```

Check the following files for these configurable items:
* [group_vars/all](group_vars/all)
* [vars/default_config.yml](vars/default_config.yml)
* [vars/config.yml](vars/config.yml)
* [inventory](inventory)
